                <p>The most successful people in the world have their morning routine down to a <em>T</em>. What's stopping you from being like them? A solid morning routine sets your tone and intentions for the day. 
                    Taking the time to take care of you before you take care of your responsibilities can reduce burnout, increase organization, and improve your mood. Here are some suggestions and tips! 
                    As always, use your best judgement with these tips, and do what works best for you.

                        <div class="grid-item one">
                            <div class="number">
                                <p><b>1</b></p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="grid-item two">
                            <p>Waking up early starts the night before. Follow the 10-3-2-1-0 rule for the best sleep: 10 hours before bedtime, no more caffeine, or at least limit it to what's found in chocolate. 
                            3 hours before bed, try to stop eating, and no more alchohol. A light snack before bed if you're starving isn't the end of the world. 2 hours before bed, stop working. 
                            Focus on relaxing and taking care of yourself. 1 hour before bed, no more screens. Read a book, take a bath, meditate, or chat with your loved one. 
                            Screens give off blue light which is counter-productive to sleep. In the morning, hit snooze 0 times. Try sitting up, breathing deeply, and opening your curtains for sunlight. 
                            Start the day with some gratitude, and decide on your intention for the day.

                        <div class="grid-item five">  
                            <p>Right after waking up, drink a big glass of water. This wakes your body up and kick-starts your metabolism. For some flavor, you could add lemon, or try green tea. 
                            Green tea is known for its antioxidants and host of other health benefits. Try to avoid coffee on an empty stomach, as it may make you jittery. 
                            Eat a good breakfast with proteins, fiber, and healthy fats. Some great ideas are smoothies, yogurt with yummy toppings, or eggs on toast with avocado!

                            <p>Take a moment to yourself to focus on mindfulness. Journaling, practicing gratitude, meditation, and stretching are all great ideas. Take time to draw attention to your breath 
                            and just exist in the moment before all the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

                            <p>Getting even a light workout in during your morning can be super beneficial. You don't have to go to the gym for two hours, you can follow a simple pilates video from the comfort of your room, 
                            follow a dance workout (those burn!), or even stretch some more. This movement will further wake up your body, preparing it for the day. 
                            It also boosts metabolism so you can actually process the food you eat for maximum nutritional benefits.

                            <p>After you've sweat a bit, now's the perfect time for your skincare routine. This can be an extension of your mindfulness practice. Take your time washing off the night and sweat, 
                            and put on your moisturizer lovingly, massaging it into your skin and really connecting with your body. If you'd like to shower, before skincare is the best time. 
                            Use the special products you've been saving for a fancy occasion. What better time to use them than today?

                            Making a to-do list, setting goals, and keeping a planner all boost productivity and cut down on decision fatigue, making for an easier day.
